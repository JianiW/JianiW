### **Hello, 你好(nǐ-hào), nong hoh👋**
This is 王佳妮Jiani Wang<br>
I was born in China from an old town called Shaoxing (where Chinese cooking wine was from). I lived in Beijing, Shanghai, Seattle, London (very briefly💂🏻‍♀️) and is currently based in New York.<br>

 #### **Academic Life📚**
 I’m a first-year master student at Columbia university studying energy policy and data science. My research primarily focuses on **tech policy💻**, **electric vehicle marekt🔋**, and **decarbonization🌳**. I'm particularly interested in understanding how private and public partnerships (PPP) shapes the market practices and policymaking processes. Throughout my time at Columbia, I plan to develop expertise in the intersection of the energy market, carbon mitigations, and public policy with abililites to provide solutions for businesses' green transformation. I'm particulary interested eletric vehicle sector with previous internship experience at the industry.<br>
 <br>
 Currently, I'm working on two research projects related to EV batteries and decarboization scenario analysis in which I hope to use evidence-based approach and quantitative analysis using data softwares to evaluate the current policies that address various approaches of climate mitigations.<br>
 <br>

  #### **Outside school🥰**
When I'm not studying, I love going out with friends to try out new restaurants. This year, I start to learn boxing🥊 and ballet🩰 so I'm not sitting in front my computer everday.<br>
<br>
I love traveling and exploring different parts of the world. Growing up in multi-cultural environment made me really enjoying interacting with people from different backgrounds. It's always facisnating me to hear cultures and traditions from different regions. <br>
